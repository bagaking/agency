## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Actions Configuration Scopes in Explorer
The editor SHALL expose Global, Project, and Agent action configuration entries in the Explorer.
Project and Agent entries SHALL require a selected Cell.

#### Scenario: Open global actions
- **WHEN** a user selects Global Actions in the Explorer
- **THEN** the editor shows the global actions configuration view

#### Scenario: Project actions without a Cell
- **WHEN** a user selects Project Actions without an active Cell
- **THEN** the editor disables editing and prompts the user to select a Cell

### Requirement: Action Scope Resolution
The editor SHALL resolve actions by applying Global, then Project, then Agent overrides by matching action ids.

#### Scenario: Project overrides global
- **WHEN** a project action shares the same action id as a global action
- **THEN** the project definition is used for execution

#### Scenario: Agent overrides project
- **WHEN** an agent action shares the same action id as a project action
- **THEN** the agent definition is used for execution

### Requirement: Action Inheritance Visibility
The editor SHALL visually distinguish inherited actions from scope-local actions and indicate when overrides exist downstream.

#### Scenario: Inherited action visible
- **WHEN** a project action is not defined locally
- **THEN** the editor marks it as inherited from Global and keeps it read-only until overridden

#### Scenario: Downstream override indicator
- **WHEN** a global action is overridden in project or agent scope
- **THEN** the global view marks it as overridden

### Requirement: Start Actions Spawn Sessions
The editor SHALL create a new terminal session when a start action is executed.

#### Scenario: Start action creates session
- **WHEN** a user runs a start action
- **THEN** the editor creates a new session, selects it, and executes the start command in that session
