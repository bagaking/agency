# Agency Editor

## Scope & Stack

- v0.2 targets macOS first while keeping a path open for cross-platform support.
- Electron + React + Tailwind CSS + Rive (animation placeholder).
- Embedded terminal via xterm.js and node-pty.
- Session keepalive uses tmux (required).

## Cell Lifecycle Files

- Each worktree contains `.agency/cell-<worktree-name>.yaml`.
- The editor reads and updates lifecycle state through this file.
- Validation is minimal (temporary) and surfaces warnings only.

## Session Keepalive (tmux)

- tmux is required; session creation is blocked if tmux is missing.
- Each worktree stores a session registry at `.agency/sessions-<worktree-name>.yaml`.
- Each Cell can have multiple sessions; stale sessions are flagged when tmux is missing or detached.
- On relaunch, the editor restores the last selected Cell and active session.

## Quick Actions

- Quick Actions are configured in the Activity Bar.
- Each action provides `startCommand` and optional `resumeCommand`.
- Definitions are stored in the editor user data directory as `quick-actions.json`.

## Branch Naming

- When creating a new Cell, the branch name is generated as `<type>/<cell-name>`.
- Available types: `feat`, `refactor`, `fix`, `lint`, `chore`, `doc`.

## Development

```bash
cd apps/editor
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

If the embedded terminal fails on macOS, run:

```bash
pnpm run postinstall
```

## Makefile (from repo root)

```bash
make editor-install
make editor-dev
```

## Environment Flags

- `AGENCY_CLI_COMMAND="codex"` override the CLI command
- `AGENCY_CLI_STUB=1` use the CLI stub script
- `AGENCY_TEST_MODE=1` use stubbed cells/worktrees

## Manual Verification

- Open the editor with tmux installed, create a session, restart the editor, and confirm the session reattaches.
- Remove or stop a tmux session, refresh sessions, and verify the session shows as stale.
- Add a quick action with both commands and verify start/resume run in the active session.

## UI Testing (Playwright)

```bash
cd apps/editor
pnpm dlx playwright install
pnpm run test:e2e
```

To create/update visual baselines:

```bash
pnpm dlx playwright test --update-snapshots
```
